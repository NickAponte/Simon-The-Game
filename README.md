# Simon-The-Game
A Recreation of Simon, the popular memory game!




# Notes
Step 1, get a simple html button representation, and pattern going

The pattern should probably be represented by an array that is randomly generated. The array should consist of numbers from 1-4 corresponding with the Simon color buttons. 

Step 2- check the pattern 

Then, when the player attempts to re-create the pattern, the player will populate their own array with the buttons they clicked.  While being populated, the function should check to make sure each added index === the array of the computer generated pattern. If not, the player lost.
